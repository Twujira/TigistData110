`Hello World`

# My Journey in the Computer World so far
1. Started from studying developing and managing a relational database by using SQL

## What skills did i acquire from SQL?

1. Database development
    - tables
    -  views
    - stored procedure
    - functions
-
Example: Tables
- Student Table
    
| StudentID | StudentName | CourseID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0123 | Tigist | 0345 |
| 0124 | Wujira | 0345 |
| 0125 | John | 0346 |

- Courses Table
   
  | CourseID | StudentID | CourseName |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 0345 | 0123 | Data110 |
  | 0346 | 0125 | Algebra |
  | 0345 | 0124 | Data110 |
  
This is what relational database mean. because of both tables have unique identifiers which is primary key in the first table is foreign key in the other table. so that they are related. and in the above example we can retrieve the name of students who are taking algebra and data110.
  
2. Database administration
  - Security
      - Grant and Deny Roles
  - Maintenance
     - Backup and disaster recovery
     - Migration (ETL is one of the ways to complete a migration process)
### What was my next step? 
# Power BI

Power BI has four parts 
- Preparing the data
- Modeling the data
- Visualize and analyze the data
- Deploy and maintain items.
-
Although i covered all this, I failed my first attempt for Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst PL-300 exam. Hopefully, i will pass at my second attempt.

  ## What's Next?
  In the meantime, i have been taking classes at Montgomery college in an on and off basis. In fall 2023, I officially declared a major and joined the data science program.
  Now, i am adding more skills in my skillset
  - **R Language**  
  - Python  
  - *Tableau*  

In addition to these skills, i will have the exposure for machine learning concepts. that motivates me to keep learning and to be a qualified competent in the data world.
